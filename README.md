# python-challenge
This challenge has two parts, one is called "PyBank" and one is called "PyPoll".

Each python script pulls in data from a .csv file. The point of this challenge is to demonstrate an ability to import modules like csv; to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; and to iterate through basic data structures.

## PyBank
This script pulls in profits/losses data from an imaginary business. The objective is to calculate the total change, the data of the greatest increase in profits, and the data of the greatest decrease in profits.

## PyPoll
This script pulls in a dataset of votes for political candidates by county. The objective is to calculate the % of votes won by each candidate, and print the winner's name.
